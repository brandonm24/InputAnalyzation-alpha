# InputAnalyzation-alpha
A requirement I have on a project that I am working on is that the software be aware of input given in any form (numeric, string, array, matrix, ... etc.) and do some possible pattern/algorithmic analysis on it if possible. That being said, my idea is to create  a variety of different Python modules that will interpret said input and ultimately form the "eyes" for my project. Branch is unstable, but will continued to be worked on until a stable beta branch can be created. If you use my work, please site me (Thanks!)
Go to the directory you save these files in and type "make" (without quotes) to run the main.py python module, which is where all additional modules will be called through.
